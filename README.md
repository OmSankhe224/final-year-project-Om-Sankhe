# 🧠 Multi-Class Thyroid Function Classification Using Lab Test Data with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview

Thyroid dysfunctions, especially **hypothyroidism**, can significantly affect metabolism, cognition, mood, and heart health. However, due to overlapping symptoms like fatigue, weight changes, and cold sensitivity, thyroid disorders are often **misdiagnosed**.

This project presents a **machine learning and deep learning-based solution** that classifies thyroid function using **clinical lab test data**, aiming to assist in **early and accurate diagnosis**.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Thyroid Disease Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/thyroid+disease)
- **Files Used**: `hypothyroid.data`, `allhyper.data`
- **Final Records**: 3,100+ patient records
- **Features**: 18 lab and clinical attributes, including:
  - TSH, T3, TT4, T4U, FTI
  - Patient age, sex, medication status, pregnancy, etc.
- **Target Classes**:
  - `0`: Negative (Normal)
  - `1`: Hypothyroid

(Note: Hyperthyroid class was dropped due to extreme imbalance.)

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing

- Replaced `?` with NaN
- Converted numerical columns to float
- Handled missing values using **mean imputation**
- Dropped irrelevant or mostly empty features (e.g., `TBG`)
- Encoded categorical features (`f`/`t`, `M`/`F`) to `0`/`1`
- Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical values

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized **class imbalance** and correlations
- Plotted:
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Boxplots by class for key features (TSH, TT4, FTI)
  - KDE plots for feature distribution
- Observed strong correlations between TT4, T3, and FTI

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Custom Neural Network (DNN)
- 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

All models were trained using the same preprocessed data.

## 🧠 Deep Learning Architectures

### 🔹 Custom DNN:
- 3 Dense layers
- ReLU + Sigmoid activations
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Optimized using `Adam` and `binary_crossentropy`

### 🔹 Tuned CNN:
- 2 Conv1D + MaxPooling + Dropout
- Flatten → Dense → Output
- Used EarlyStopping to avoid overfitting
- Best performance among all models
